    use: .*
      # The .* implies using available proxies, 'use' keyword is for this in some formats, or just list them
      # This behavior (select .*) is tricky. In standard Clash YAML, you list proxy names or provider names.
      # Assuming it means all available proxies not already in specific groups.
      # This will likely need manual adjustment based on actual available proxies/providers.
      # For now, leaving it empty as direct conversion of '.*' is not standard.
      # Consider creating a group that includes all your individual proxy nodes if that's the intent.
